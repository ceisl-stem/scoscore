	abstract = {Quantitative research enjoys heightened esteem among policy-makers, media, and the general public. Whereas qualitative research is frequently dismissed as subjective and impressionistic, statistics are often assumed to be objective and factual. We argue that these distinctions are wholly false; quantitative data is no less socially constructed than any other form of research material. The first part of the paper presents a conceptual critique of the field with empirical examples that expose and challenge hidden assumptions that frequently encode racist perspectives beneath the façade of supposed quantitative objectivity. The second part of the paper draws on the tenets of Critical Race Theory (CRT) to set out some principles to guide the future use and analysis of quantitative data. These ‘QuantCrit’ ideas concern (1) the centrality of racism as a complex and deeply rooted aspect of society that is not readily amenable to quantification; (2) numbers are not neutral and should be interrogated for their role in promoting deficit analyses that serve White racial interests; (3) categories are neither ‘natural’ nor given and so the units and forms of analysis must be critically evaluated; (4) voice and insight are vital: data cannot ‘speak for itself’ and critical analyses should be informed by the experiential knowledge of marginalized groups; (5) statistical analyses have no inherent value but can play a role in struggles for social justice.},

	abstract = {Our purpose is to proffer QuantCrit methodological approaches to interrogate notions of statistical practice by convention. We present two approaches to meta-analysis and mean effect size calculations for student achievement. The first approach is the conventional approach which applies between-group differences to calculate effect sizes representing achievement gaps. The second approach is commonly referred to as a single-group summary meta-analysis within the medical literature, which calculates within-group mean differences referred to here as student growth. In the conventional study, 39 independent effect sizes were combined to produce an overall mean difference effect size of −.85, which indicated that the average difference in performance between Black and White girl literacy was almost one standard deviation. The second approach summarized the mean differences from 33 effect sizes using the previous administration year as the comparison group. A statistically significant mean difference of .09 was observed for the QuantCrit approach. Our study contributes to the literature on racially just epistemologies by providing concurrent analyses of meta-analytic data to expose the unique features of QuantCrit that make it distinct from traditional approaches to Quantitative research.},
